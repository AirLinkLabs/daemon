Skyport Daemon is the daemon for the Skyport Panel.

## Installation

2. Install dependencies:
`npm install`

3. Configure Skyportd:
- Get your Panel's access key from the Skyport panel's config.json file and set it as 'remoteKey'. Do the same for the other way, set your skyportd access key and configure it on the Panel.
